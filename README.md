# UdaciCards

This is my code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

## Instructions:

- Clone Project
- run `yarn install` followed by `yarn start`. You can alternatively use `npm install` & `npm start`

The styling is very bare minimum.. I focused on functionality for my submission. I will definitely continue to work on this to improve it as a whole.

All requested features work as expected.
